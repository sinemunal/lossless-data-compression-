### lossless-data-compression
Lossless data compression using arithmetic coding and Burrows-Wheeler transform :


Detailed explanation of the overall algorithm and its performance on different files can be found
in the attached [report](https://github.com/sinemunal/lossless-data-compression-/blob/master/report.pdf).

To run the data_compression program from terminal, type 

* For compression  : 
```
./path_to/data_compression -e filename&extension

```
* For decompression :
```
./path_to/data_compression -d filename&extension

```
